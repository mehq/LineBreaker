LineBreaker
===========

This desktop game was developed as the final project for my Computer Graphics
course during my Bachelor's degree. It was written in C (C11 standard) and
uses the GLUT library.


To run this project, please install the necessary OpenGL libraries by entering
the following command:

apt-get install mesa-common-dev freeglut3-dev


Then, compile the project using the command:

make


To run the game, use the following command:

Please note that this game was developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04, and should
be compatible with most Debian-based systems.
